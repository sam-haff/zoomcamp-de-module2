Answer: green_tripdata_2020-04.csv
 
Explanation:
- Variable rendering is very similar to 
string interpolation in Python. In that very case:
    taxi = "green"
    year = "2020"
    mo = "04"
    res = f'{taxi}_tripdata_{year}_{mo}.csv'
<res> will be rendered value.(for explanation purposes 
only, as it's easily done in the mind)
